So, who am I?
My name's Boris Budini, I was born in Durres, Albania.

At the age  of 14, I was introduced to the amazing world of open source, when I started to attend events of [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc)

Ever since, I was blown away from the idea of sharing for the greater good, which then became one of my core morals.
I've been involved with various projects.
Right now, I'm part of Mozilla Tech Speakers, and a volunteer to projects which promote privacy, freedom, and security. One of those projects is [CityZen](https://github.com/CityZenApp)

I am part of [Collective68](https://collective68.tech), which is a team of open source professionals who do consulting and much more

I also do various projects, which may on may not have to do with IoT, Music, DIY and so on.

Whenever I'm not doing any of those things, I'm bingewatching TV Shows.
