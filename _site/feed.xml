&lt;p&gt;I love this software so much, I decided to write a blog post on how awesome it is and how much it helped Open Labs Hackerspace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Labs Hackerspace is non for profit, and when we were struggling for sponsorships, we used to use Google Groups as a mailing list. 
We didn’t like this, but back then we had no option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, an awesome company named DigitalOcean sponsored Open Labs Hackerspace.
If you know me, you know what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/128kpIwiArqvUk&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important part of infra we needed, was a mailing list which was open source, and user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Discourse came into play.
It’s a beautiful software allowing users to communicate with each-other asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Discourse is a from-scratch reboot, an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion forum should be today, in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook, and Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can go on for months telling all the good sides that convinced us to use it, but it’s better to show you all Discourse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discourse.org/features&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs pretty well on 1GB, although Open Labs Hackerspace needs 4GB of RAM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting it up was super easy. DigitalOcean has the option to create a droplet/server with Discourse preinstalled, so installing it took 5 minutes.
In order to send emails, we decided to use SparkPost (they’re a free SMTP service which allows us to send as many emails as our users request)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only complaint that I have, is that the software is updated so much, it’s hard to keep up with new versions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-active-is-our-forum&quot;&gt;How active is our forum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, from the start, we have had&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;214 users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;695 topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5500 posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider that insane!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cool-tricks&quot;&gt;Cool tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discourse is both a forum, and a mailing list. And it does a great job of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidtaylorhq/discourse-telegram-notifications&quot;&gt;Telegram bot&lt;/a&gt;, which when linked with your account, it sends your Discourse notifications to Telegram
By using this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fuerst/embed-etherpad-lite&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; we can embed our etherpad.
We disabled comments on &lt;a href=&quot;openlabs.cc&quot;&gt;openlabs.cc&lt;/a&gt;, and started using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/wp-discourse&quot;&gt;wp-discourse&lt;/a&gt; to post our blog posts on the forum, and use replies as comments.
The badges offer a nice way for users to “compete” which eachother on a friendly way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discourse has definitively helped Open Labs Hackerspace better communicate, organize, and share.
It is now part of our core Infra, and it is my favorite software!
I would highly recommend it to any open source community which values beautiful, feature rich &amp;amp; secure mailing lists&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">On 5th of March 2016, I installed Discourse on forum.openlabs.cc</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Automation between your server and GitHub</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/server-github-automation" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automation between your server and GitHub" /><published>2018-08-27T02:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-27T02:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Server-GitHub-automation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/server-github-automation">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was asked to find a way of automating one of Ura’s production servers, to automatically get the code from GitHub, compile it, and then serve it. We were using Jekyll, so it was pretty easy to be solved.. except for the automatic pull. I ended up using a php script + webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first things firsts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-webhook&quot;&gt;What is a webhook?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A webhook is a pretty cool method of communication between servers.
Think of it this way.
We have server A and server B. Whenever server A finishes a task, server B needs to be informed. This is where webhooks come in.
After the task in server A is completed, it sends a webhook to server B.
Webhook is kind of like a message!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-programming-language-did-you-use&quot;&gt;What programming language did you use?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up using PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-did-i-do-it&quot;&gt;So, how did I do it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed Apache2 &amp;amp; PHP7.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; apache2 php7.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, i ran &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone [URL]&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www&lt;/code&gt; which created &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/repo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then i created &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/repo/script&lt;/code&gt; and under that directory, a file named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[name].php&lt;/code&gt;. There, i pasted the content of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/oodavid/1809044/raw/ba8d01c411c40c2d204aa0eda93f72bea757b5d3/deploy.php&quot;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oodavid&quot;&gt;oodavid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set the permission to Apache user (-R means recursive)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;chown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; www-data:www-data /var/www/repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then executed this command from inside &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/www/repo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;jekyll serve &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--watch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; window. This allows the website to be updated everytime there’s a file change
My apache site config file looks like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;
        ServerName ..................

        ProxyPass /script !
        Alias &quot;/script&quot; &quot;/var/www/..../script/deploy.php&quot;

        ProxyPass / http://0.0.0.0:4000/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://0.0.0.0:4000/

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        &amp;lt;Directory &quot;/var/www/....&quot;&amp;gt;
        AllowOverride All
        &amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on the appropriate repo on GitHub, i set a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; webhook &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;On push events&lt;/code&gt;, with the url &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[URL]/script&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-but-why&quot;&gt;Okay, but why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of automation allows us to do many fun stuff. 
Back in March, it was impossible to have custom domains on GitHub pages WITH SSL. Our develpers didn’t have access to servers, so this helped us to have https://ura.design, https://identihub.co, and allowed me to have https://budini.xyz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t it’s only use case.
On Identihub, we have 4 main facing Identihub instances. 
There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.identihub.co&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;, which is our showcase, &lt;a href=&quot;https://master.identihub.co&quot;&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.identihub.co&quot;&gt;Dev&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://test.identihub.co&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;. The last three are automatically synced with this very same method! So, you can achieve realtime deployment with little to no hassle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A few months ago, I was asked to find a way of automating one of Ura’s production servers, to automatically get the code from GitHub, compile it, and then serve it.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Router:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. - Wikipedia
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means your router is like the traffic police, dictating the flow of the internet in your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS - Domain Name System:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; The Domain Name System is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers connected to the Internet. - Wikipedia
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS serves as the roads, deciding where the cars go. Whenever you visit my website for example, you actually visit  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;206.189.248.153&lt;/code&gt;. But you won’t remember that, will you? (Even I don’t)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dig into the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So recently I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;, and was too lazy to manually edit the DNS record in all of my devices (I have a lot of devices in my network ._.)
That means that I needed to edit the DNS record directly from my router.
Easy peasy…Right? 
My ISP is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.albtelecom.al&quot;&gt;ALBtelecom&lt;/a&gt;, and while they do have a good service, their routers aren’t the best out there. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://consumer.huawei.com/eg-en/support/smart-home/hg531-v1-10/&quot;&gt;HG531 V1&lt;/a&gt;. This guy is good enough for my devices, so I like it
Now, it’s no secret that every ISP provides their DNS, and I get that.
The problem arose when I wanted to change it.
ALBtelecom told me my router credentials were &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U5er!us3r!&lt;/code&gt;.
So I log in and I see only these panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-columns=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Tech/router/admin1.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Tech/router/admin2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’s all the other options?” - I wondered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Look&amp;#39;s like ALBtelecom (ISP) blocks a lot of features on their firmware and stops users from replacing that firmware. Let&amp;#39;s see what we can do, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; borisbudini (@kominoshja) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kominoshja/status/1028427917792096257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i got angry and decided to get on the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried many things, from trying to get access from any port, to all the possible hardware button press combos, opening the router itself, but nothing worked. So I decided to get the firmware file online, unpack it, and work backwards from there to see if they changed the firmware upgrade URL (I initially thought they wrote a custom firmware). That didn’t work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only option was to get access to the router through the serial connector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, I saw this one search result, mentioning ALBtelecom and HG531 in the same sentence.
It was a third party website, selling the firmware for around 3$. I am extremely against paywalls, but between buying this or waiting a month for the serial connectors to arrive, i had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I payed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the files in there, I saw something mentioning a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account.  Apparently, ALBtelecom didn’t flash their own firmware, they just created a basic-access user named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;. Geez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I logged in, and there it was. &lt;strong&gt;Full access to the router that I payed for, and was limited to use 1/5th of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-columns=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Tech/router/root1.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Tech/router/root2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just got the highest privilege possible on ALBtelecom&amp;#39;s HG531 V1. Blog post coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; borisbudini (@kominoshja) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kominoshja/status/1028949947251609600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 13, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you just want to get the account details, here they are: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@csC0nf1g.&lt;/code&gt;
In case you want to know why I made such a big deal is out of this, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By locking our access in our routers, ALBtelecom is taking away a part of our freedom!
Yes, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you can’t change the DNS records, ALBtelecom WILL KNOW WHAT SITE YOU VISIT, even if you’re using VPN. [Unless you took protection against DNS leak, or changed the DNS settings for your device(Yeah, sure, you can change the DNS records on every device you have, or you can do it the sane way)]
The other problem I have with this  is that, I payed for the router. I bought it! Therefore, you have no right to lock me access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the actual case on ALBtelecom&amp;#39;s HG531 v1 router. They don&amp;#39;t give you an admin level access router. They give you a simple user named `admin` (misleading) which allows you only to set wifi name &amp;amp; password, and PPPoE login settings (1)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; borisbudini (@kominoshja) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kominoshja/status/1029015232801398784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 13, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HG531 V1 router is actually very nice, for 15-20 devices connected to it, and it rarely has failed for me. However there’s no info regarding it online. 
So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kominoshja/budini.xyz/tree/master/assets/hg531-fimwares&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find all the firmware I was able to get for it. Use them wisely! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Before you read the story, let’s cover some bases on understanding why this matters.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">whoami - Growing up with Abuse</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/whoami" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="whoami - Growing up with Abuse" /><published>2018-06-30T02:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-06-30T02:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/whoami</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/whoami">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This post contains abuse &amp;amp; self harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April of 2017, Justin Flory wrote an article on Medium, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jwflory/turn-on-the-lights-267603e553b5&quot;&gt;Turn on the lights&lt;/a&gt;
I remember reading it back then, and feeling so blown away by his courage, to talk about something so personal.
So, before I say anything else, Justin, I want to thank you, for inspiring me to talk about something that truly matters to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a story of mine, a story of how I grew up, and who I became the person I am today. This is a story that I have been afraid of telling, but recently realized that, if I say silent, all that’s happening is more damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Albania, a country located in Balkans. I was born and raised on Durres, a city full of sea, sand, and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much I truly remember about my childhood. I remember growing up in a small neighborhood, which was filled with families which together formed a community. There was a lot happening to me, in a time when  I didn’t fully understand what was happening. I was abused as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;tenor-gif-embed&quot; data-postid=&quot;5956836&quot; data-share-method=&quot;host&quot; data-width=&quot;100%&quot; data-aspect-ratio=&quot;2.4292682926829268&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tenor.com/view/harry-potter-black-sheep-family-go-gif-5956836&quot;&gt;Harry Potter Black GIF&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenor.com/search/harrypotter-gifs&quot;&gt;Harrypotter GIFs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://tenor.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only came to this realization around 11/2016. Growing up, I always thought that it was normal to be blamed for everything as a child, of being insulted, and of being threatened. Even now, as of writing this, I still cannot tell whether what happened was normal or not. 
The way that I found out that what was happening to me wasn’t normal, was also a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember I was googling various things of my personality (Which is something that, to this day, I still do)
Near the bottom of my screen, there was this link, leading to a page that described forms of abuse, abusive behavior, and symptoms.
Recalling that moment now, I remember feeling this sort of instinctual click, as if my subconscious clicked it as soon as it saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading it, I just couldn’t believe how everything that was going on suddenly made sense. As if the last piece of the puzzle was put into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/wSSKW1k9x3xxC&quot; width=&quot;330&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/water-float-drown-wSSKW1k9x3xxC&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was 15 years old, I had all these feelings of hatred, hopelessness, worthlessness. I knew they were feelings used to describe depression, but it didn’t really fit.
After a while, I started doing self-harming behavior. I don’t know why, or how I had the thought of doing that, but it was something that made me feel better. I kept doing it, every  day, from October/November of 2015 to 28th of December 2016, with the exception of summer, because I didn’t want my mom to see my cuts. I was addicted to it, and couldn’t stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have people that were trying to help me, but I didn’t understand why I felt that way, so there wasn’t really anyway for anyone to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that was keeping me &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alive&lt;/code&gt; back then, was Open Labs Hackerspace. I don’t know how to describe it, but that place became my home, when I was feeling homeless. However, that’s a story that deserves it’s own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned 15, I was freshmen in high-school.  There, I met these two people, who, for some reason, decided they wanted to be there for me no matter what I said. (They had seen my cuts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 28th of December 2016, I remember hitting rock bottom. I had managed to cut myself deeper than ever before. It was at the point where the place was full of towels with blood. Sitting there, in pain, I had this experience where, I saw myself from outside of my body. It was as if seeing a movie where I was playing the main role, and everything wrong that I was doing became obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point I realized that, even though I thought I was alone, and felt like it, wasn’t.
And that was the moment I started feeling hope again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, I still live with my abuser. 
They do not understand that what they do is abuse, and that it’s harmful. 
But at least my mind is safe because, I know that, they won’t have another kid to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they are not alone.&lt;/strong&gt;
And this is what convinced me to write this post. Because, I’m nor the first nor the last person who dealt with abuse. Yes, abusers are not alone. They have eachother. But so are we. I know how it feels, when you feel as if you were a mistake, like a parasite of the earth.  But please, hear me when I say that you’re not. 
Being abused, is weird. There’s no words that can describe it, let alone describe how you feel. What happened to you was unjust. But you were not a mistake. Abuse, is a cycle, it’s passed from generation to generation. And so, &lt;strong&gt;it is our duty, to break the cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. So that the kids of tomorrow, don’t have to suffer what we suffered through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you ever feel like you need to open up to someone, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/kominoshja&quot;&gt;reach me&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no such thing as bad time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last paragraph of this post, I want to thank some people who, were there for me, even if they didn’t realize it back at the time. 
I want to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://redon.skikuli.com/&quot;&gt;Redon Skikuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elioqoshi.me/&quot;&gt;Elio Qoshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jona.azizaj.com/&quot;&gt;Jona Azizaj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kristiprogri.com/&quot;&gt;Kristi Progri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arapisilva?lang=en&quot;&gt;Silva Arapi&lt;/a&gt; and every member of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openlabs.cc&quot;&gt;Open Labs Hackerspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You guys provided a home and a family for me, without asking for anything in return. Second I want to rethank &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinwflory.com/&quot;&gt;Justin Flory&lt;/a&gt;, for giving me the courage to talk about this. And I also want to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://tannerfilip.org/&quot;&gt;Tanner Filip&lt;/a&gt;, Arber Shytermeja , Artemisa Themeli, and everybody who reached out to me in time of need.
